/Manipulating molecules through LaTeX from Emacs/.

* Intro
=tochemfig= is an Emacs interface to the =mol2chemfig= python package.
Generate chemfig code from mol or SMILES.

* Requirements
This package requires a working Python environment
with the =mol2chemfigPy3= package installed and accessible via shell.
If you miss the package, install it with this command (through =pip=):

#+begin_src bash
pip install -U mol2chemfigPy3
#+end_src

* Installation
This package is under development, so it's not available on MELPA yet.
If you really can't wait, you can install it through this git repo.
The package is already functional: some function could be renamed soon.
